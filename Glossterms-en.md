# Glossterms

A [**topic**](#_N65bcef382f84a) is a container for your content and
building blocks for your output. You create content inside a
[**topic**](#_N65bcef382f84a) by adding elements for paragraphs, images,
procedures, bullet lists, tables and more. You can add as many block
elements and inline elements as you need, but the maximum permitted size
for a topic is 1 [**MB**](#_N65bce9bf0d128).

Baseform: Instead of writing all **sections** in one large file, you
write each **section** in a separate **topic**. For best practice, each
**topic** should focus on one subject or task.

Linked: Instead of writing all [**sections**](#_N65bcedaadb21f) in one
large file, you write each [**section**](#_N65bcedaadb21f) in a separate
[**topic**](#_N65bcef382f84a). For best practice, each
[**topic**](#_N65bcef382f84a) should focus on one subject or task.

A [**glossterm**](#_N65cb1f4d25095) referred from the content should be
included in the glossary (i.e [**Term referred from
content**](#_N65c3285c52671)).
